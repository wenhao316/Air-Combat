Proposal

                        ** Final Project Proposal**
For my final project I would like to develop a game that would allow users to control a spaceship using keyboard to dodgeparticles shown on the screen or choose to fire at paraticles. If the player get hit by a sprite particle then the player would lose a health bar. When the players have no health bar left the game ends. When the player destroyes some particle they gain a certain amout of points, and as the player plays longer the game's difficulty goes up. I plan on increasing the difficulty by increase the speed of the particle movements(pixles / sec). At the end of the game, the screen would display the player's score. 

** Library **
For my Libraries I am using a library from  (https://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/setting-an-image-as-canvass-background/16960/2) which allows me to set a image as a background.  Canvas class allows me
to essentially use image to be my background and object in the game.

I am also using ofxGui (https://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/extending-ofxgui-with-new-widgets/16670) which will allow me to create a UI that users can choose to play a game, restart a game, or exit the game.

I am usign ofSoundPlayer to play background music during the game.

My purpose of this project is to make a basic game and help myself learn how to use openframework
